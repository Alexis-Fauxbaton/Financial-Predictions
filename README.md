# Financial-Predictions

This project aims at developing a framework in which one could use ML algorithms to create new indicators for financial markets and backtest their strategies. 

On the TODO list: 
  - Split different sections of the project (RL / strategy based live trading agents / Data processing / Supervised techniques / etc) and rewrite sections that need refactoring
  - Find efficient ways to incorporate Machine Learning to existing indicators to create meaningful signals
  - Find an efficient way to implement a backest environment for any strategy
  
This project is still in an early development stage, and a lot of work is still needed in order to fulfill its objectives. See dev branch for latest updates
